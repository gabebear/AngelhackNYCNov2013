We help people find they stuff they want.

Customers search our site and add passes for specific items or categories of items. We also encourage other sites to embed links to our passbook passes. Passes will activate when what customers want is close-by.

Places that want to be found use a low power beacon to advertise what they offer. Places get a beacon either by buying a BaconBeacon from us or by dedicating a iPhone or iPad to the task. Once they have a beacon they can configure their beacon to advertise any amount of services or products. They can change this anytime from their phone.

BaconBeacon keeps up with linking individual passes with the changing services/items around the customers by pushing updates to passbook in the background.
